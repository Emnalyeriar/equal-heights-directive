# Equal Heights Directive.
=====================================

This is a Angular directive that sets the same height on elements in the same row. It is designed to work with the Twitter Bootstrap grid but it can be easily adjusted to any grid system or html structure.

You can see an example [here](http://codepen.io/Emnalyeriar/pen/gbZqjz).

By default it calculates the elements height when the sites loads, if you need to call it manually (for example when the an loads) then require this directive inside your own directive and call the method `setHeights()`.
